    <h4 class="text-xl font-medium py-2">1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h4>
    <p>The scope of var variable is a Global.That's means we can use var not only inside the function but also globally.we can reassing ,re-declear the var's value.</p>
        
     <p>Let and const is a block scope.That's means we can't access the let and const's value globally we also use it in there own function. we cannot re-assign, re-declear. but only for let we can update the value. <span class="text-lg bg-green-200">but const doesn't give use the chance for update. </span></p>

     <h4 class="text-xl font-medium py-2">2. Usecase of null and undefined</h4>

     <p>Null means an empty value in Javascript.It's means a variable which assign null as no value.</p>
     <p>Undefined means a variable which has been decleared but it's value is not given. <span class="bg-pink-200 text-lg">like we take a variable like x,y,z but we don't know what is the value of this.</span>if we check the type of this then we get undefined because we declear this burt what will be the value it's not defined.  </p>

     <h4 class="text-xl font-medium py-2">3. Rest API</h4>
     <P>REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. Itâ€™s used to fetch or give some information from a web service. All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request. </P>
     <p><span class="text-lg bg-purple-200">In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.</span> These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.  </p>
